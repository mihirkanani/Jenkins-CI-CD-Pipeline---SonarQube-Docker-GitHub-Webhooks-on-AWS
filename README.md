üìù Project Steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Repository in GitHub:**
Pushing my code repository into GitHub to kickstart the automation process.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **EC2 Instances Galore:**
Setting up three EC2 instances for Jenkins server, SonarQube server, and Docker server to build a resilient infrastructure.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **GitHub + Jenkins Webhook Magic:**
Integrating GitHub Webhooks with the Jenkins server for seamless automation triggered by code pushes.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Analysis Nirvana:**
Connecting SonarQube with Jenkins to perform in-depth code analysis and maintain code quality.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Dockerizing the Game:**
After a successful SonarQube integration, installing Docker desktop on an EC2 instance to containerize the application.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Jenkins + Docker Harmony:**
Copying Jenkins project files into Docker and crafting a Dockerfile to encapsulate the project.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Containerizing Excellence:**
Running the Docker package and initiating the container, ensuring a smooth deployment.

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Web Application Awesomeness:**
Voila! Accessing the web application by navigating to the Docker instance on your browser, making the results of your hard work tangible.

üí° **Key Takeaway:** This project not only streamlines the development and deployment process but also enhances code quality with SonarQube integration. A hands-on journey into the world of DevOps, and this is just the beginning! üöÄ
